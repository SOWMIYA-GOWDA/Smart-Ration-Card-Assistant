# Smart-Ration-Card-Assistant
**📌 About the Project**

This project is a Smart Ration Card Chatbot designed to provide quick information to ration cardholders.
It answers queries like:

-Cardholder details (name, address, family members, type, etc.)

-Stock availability based on family size

-Government updates related to ration cards

-Shop working hours

-Restock dates

The chatbot uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a simple dataset of 15 sample ration card records.

**🎯 Features (with descriptions)**
-Interactive Chat UI → Clean chatbot interface with user/bot chat bubbles.

-Typing Effect → Bot replies like a human with a "typing..." animation.

-Voice Output → Option to hear responses via speech synthesis.

-Timestamps → Each chat message is shown with date & time.

-Dynamic Replies → Different responses based on user commands (details, stock, govt update, timing, restock).

-Reset Button → Restart the chatbot anytime for a fresh conversation.

-Front Page Start Button → Welcomes users before entering chat mode.

**🚀 How It Works**

User enters a ration card number (e.g., RC001).

**Bot responds based on query type:**

-RC001 details → Shows cardholder and family details.

-RC001 stock → Shows ration items available (kg depends on family members).

-RC001 govt update → Displays pending/updated information.

-RC001 timing → Tells shop open/close status (9 AM – 6 PM).

-RC001 restock → Shows next restock date.

HTML5 → Structure

CSS3 → Styling (chat bubbles, background, layout)

JavaScript (ES6) → Chatbot logic, dataset handling, typing animation, timestamps, speech synthesis
